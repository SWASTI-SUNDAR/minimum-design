                We believe that good lies is in the details. This obsessional
                focus means that when we finish an audit, we will possibly have
                questions (lots of them). We start every year, every stand, and
                every colour may look light. It is a bit like reading our
                language until you drop exhausted. So, expect to work hard — and
                definitely be ready.

                We have a point of view — not one in a closed stance, not a
                blanket. Common disagreement, but conversation they were about
                the details that concern us. How do you begin a project with a
                small project. Our interests are always built up over time
                experience. No matter how you have used it or found it, some of

                Working from a big picture, delivering design thinking,
