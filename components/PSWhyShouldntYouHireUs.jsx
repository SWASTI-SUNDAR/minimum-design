                1. Our OCD for details might bother you

              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                Because “almost right” is still wrong. We believe the devil
                truly lies in the details. The emotional micro-nuances that
                others overlook are exactly where we focus our craft. We
                question, refine, and polish until every pixel, every word, and
                every interaction feels right. It’s highly possible our
                obsession with precision might test your patience — but trust
                us, you’ll love the results.

              </h4>
              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                We argue about pixels, not payments.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                We love a good debate — as long as it’s about ideas, not
                invoices. Creative disagreements fuel innovation; they make the
                work stronger. But when it comes to business, we prefer clarity
                over chaos. Our contracts are water-tight, our terms
                transparent. Because tying up loose ends at onset helps build
                long-term, sustainable relationships.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                We treat time like design — with precision and respect. Wasting
                it is a big no-no, whether it&apos;s about meeting a deadline or
                joining a call. We hold ourselves to the same standards we
                expect from our partners — we&apos;ll make up for our delays,
                and might just charge interest for yours. Fair is fair.

                There&apos;s always a cheaper option — and a better reason to

              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                Bespoke experiences come at a price — and rightfully so.
                There&apos;s always a cheaper version out there, but that&apos;s
                not us. We don&apos;t cut corners, we craft edges. Every pixel,
                every process, and every promise comes with intention and
                precision.We believe in fair value — for the time, talent, and
                thinking that shape meaningful design. And yes, we have bills to
                pay too — mostly from buying better coffee and obsessing over
                better work.

              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                Once you&apos;ve hired us, your problem becomes our obsession.
                We don&apos;t just design — we own the outcome. From kickoff to
                launch (and every chaotic Slack thread in between), we take
                responsibility like it&apos;s our name on the door. We stay till
                it works — not just till it&apos;s delivered. Because real
                design doesn&apos;t stop at handoff; it succeeds when it
                succeeds for you.

              <p className="text-sm lato-light leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-light">
                If we ever feel the timing or fit isn&apos;t right, we&apos;ll
                wait until it is. The best ideas win here — not titles, not
                tenure, not egos or finances. We believe on collaboration,
                curiosity, and healthy disagreements. If we feel something
                isn&apos;t right for you, you&apos;ll hear it — loud and clear.
                We&apos;re not in the business of half-hearted ideas.
